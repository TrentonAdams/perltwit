<p>perltwit is a command line application written in perl.  It supports
sending tweets as any number of users using OAuth.</p>

<p>perltwit is very simple.  Copy the "twitter" script to /usr/local/bin, and
ensure the required perl libraries are installed on your machine.  If
desired, you may use cpan to install them, or at your option a package
manager for the Linux distribution you are using may also be used; if it
provides the required packages.</p>

<p>Once install into your PATH in some form or another, and upon first run,
the application will ask you for a consumer key and consumer secret.
Basically, this means you must go to twitter and register an application
there, as a developer.  You can find the apps section under "Settings".<br>
Call it whatever you like.  You should keep this consumer key and key
secret..., well..., SECRET. :D</p>

<p>The next thing that you will be asked for, is an authentication key for the
user that you'd like to use for tweeting.  This is stored in a special file
under ~/.twitter/twitter-${user}.conf, where ${user} is replaced with the
user specified to the -f parameter.</p>

<p>If you ran...
twitter -f twitteruser -m 'How many tweets can a twit tweet if a twit could tweet tweets?'
You'd have a config in ~/.twitter/twitter-twitteruser.conf that stores a
special authentication key for that user.  You'll never be asked for a
password, or authentication of any form ever again.</p>
