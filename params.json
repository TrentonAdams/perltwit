It supports\r\nsending tweets as any number of users using OAuth.\r\n\r\nperltwit is very simple.  Copy the \"twitter\" script to /usr/local/bin, and\r\nensure the required perl libraries are installed on your machine.  If\r\ndesired, you may use cpan to install them, or at your option a package\r\nmanager for the Linux distribution you are using may also be used; if it\r\nprovides the required packages.\r\n\r\nOnce install into your PATH in some form or another, and upon first run,\r\nthe application will ask you for a consumer key and consumer secret.\r\nBasically, this means you must go to twitter and register an application\r\nthere, as a developer.  You can find the apps section under \"Settings\".  \r\nCall it whatever you like.  You should keep this consumer key and key\r\nsecret..., well..., SECRET. :D\r\n\r\nThe next thing that you will be asked for, is an authentication key for the\r\nuser that you'd like to use for tweeting.  This is stored in a special file\r\nunder ~/.twitter/twitter-${user}.conf, where ${user} is replaced with the\r\nuser specified to the -f parameter.\r\n\r\nIf you ran...\r\ntwitter -f twitteruser -m 'How many tweets can a twit tweet if a twit could tweet tweets?'\r\nYou'd have a config in ~/.twitter/twitter-twitteruser.conf that stores a\r\nspecial authentication key for that user.  You'll never be asked for a\r\npassword, or authentication of any form ever again.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
